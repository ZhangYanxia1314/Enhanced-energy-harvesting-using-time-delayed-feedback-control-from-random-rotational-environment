# The file WH_Iteration.m is for computing the energy-dependent frequency where calls four function files, i.e., Hh.m, tt.m, xa.m, xb.m.
# The file U_X.m is used to show the variations of the potential function and the potential well depth.
# The file PDF_Theory.m is used to compute the stationary probability density function.
# The file PDF_MCS.m is used for numerical simulation by MCS for the stationary probability density function.
# The file EP.m is used to compute the mean output power.
# The file SNR_D_v.m is used to compute the signal-to-noise ratio SNR.
# The file Vrms_rho.m is used to compute the output RMS voltage and the power conversion efficiency.
